# Perturbation-based BERT-Analyzer

This is a small project based on the approach from https://github.com/icml2019paper2428/Towards-A-Deep-and-Unified-Understanding-of-Deep-Neural-Models-in-NLP.

The script BERTAnalyzer.py takes in a sentence and looks how important each word is for the BERT model.
This is done by the INterpreter.py using perturbation approximation from the paper "Towards a Deep and Unified Understanding of Deep Neural Models in NLP" http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/guan19a.html
